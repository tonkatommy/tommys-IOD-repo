## Lab #1: Figma
Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your
content and posts from other users are visible.  
Donâ€™t just jump into Figma, try to follow the design procedure.  
Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with a personal design.  
For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.
