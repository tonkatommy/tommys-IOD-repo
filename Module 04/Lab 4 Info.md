Lab #1: Figma

Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your
content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t just jump into Figma, try to follow
the design procedure.
Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with
a personal design. For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the
Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.


Lab #2: Templates

Exercise 1 :
Modify the addCard function from the previous slide
so that you can pass the content for the card
dynamically.

Exercise 2 :
Call addCard repeatedly so that your cards are
automatically generated based on data from an array.
This way you will create as many cards as you need to
display all the data in the array.

Exercise 3 - the artist’s portfolio:
Generate multiple templates and populate the page
dynamically. Create an artist profile card and generate
cards representing the items in an artist's portfolio.


Lab #3 - Calculator

In this exercise you will need to create a
calculator.

Requirements:
The application should take 2 numbers, and
can do 4 operations (+, / , x , -) .
You need to press the equals button to get
the result displayed, and reset to clear it.

NOTE: Do not use the eval() function - it is a
security risk and bypasses custom logic.


Lab #4 – Display Cards Bootstrap

Using only bootstrap
elements, create this
grid-based card layout,
making it responsive.

4 cards per row on large
screens (and above),
2 cards per row on medium
screens, and 1 card per row
on small (and below) screens.
